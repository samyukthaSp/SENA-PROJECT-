Problem Statement

Visualization of Network graph of Airline system to illustrate varying viewpoints in the mapping of air travel.

A lot of factors affect the overall price of airline tickets, including the airline, the date of travel, source, destination, route, duration, and so on. Each provider seems to have its own unique set of regulations and methods for determining pricing. Recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) allow for the inference of such principles as well as the modelling of price volatility. While we might hear about those aspects the most, the customer experience is not about just the flight itself. It’s everything from purchasing reasonable  tickets to quality airline availability and thoughtful bookings. It’s important that customers have an excellent experience every time they travel.
